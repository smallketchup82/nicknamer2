# nicknamer2
The next generation nicknamer bot.

# Installation
Run using docker (this is the way I do it, and its probably the best way to run it).

1. Clone the repository
2. Cd into the directory
3. Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and fill it in.
4. Create `data` directory. Should be as easy as running `mkdir data`
5. Run `docker-compose up -d`
